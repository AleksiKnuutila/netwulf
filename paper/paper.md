# Summary

I'm just collecting some thoughts here

* visualizing networks is an important part of communicating their structure
* there already exist several tools to explore/visualize networks and their structure and properties.
* "networkx" [@networkx] is the most commonly used Python package for network analysis
* it provides visualization functions which are either slow or inconvenient as they
  rely on third-party dependencies like "graphviz" [@graphviz], and use a
  a variety of parameters. These parameters then have to be manually scanned, 
  reproducing a new visualization for every changed parameter.
* Gephi [@gephi] is mostly focused on both interactive analysis and visualization.
  However, networks must be saved and loaded as separate files. Java has to be installed.
  an automated view of a network which was previously manipulated in Python is not possbile
* Webweb [@webweb] provides an interactive visualization for Python network objects based
  on the force layout of d3.js [@d3], however
  its main purpose is exploration of network features
  and single-time visualizations:
  the stylized network and visualization parameters may not be saved to reproduce
  Further, a variety of styling parameters are only accessible through its API
  which again may provide difficulties when trying to find the optimal visualization.
* Netwulf provides a simple interactive interface to stylize a network which was previously
  manipulated in Python. 
* Its philosophy is that network manipulation should be done programmatically (i.e. in Python)
  but the efficient generation of a visually pleasing network representation should be
  done manually
* Its main purpose is to easily generate both a network visualization
  and find the optimal visualization parameters to reproduce the visualization. To this end, both are 
  saved to objects in the Python instance running Netwulf.
* It further provides functionality to
  redraw the visualization in Python using matplotlib [@matplotlib] to save it as a vector graphic
  or image in arbitrary resolution.
* more description
