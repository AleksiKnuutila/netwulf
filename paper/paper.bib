@inproceedings{ellson_graphviz_2001,
	title = {Graphviz {\textemdash} open source graph drawing tools},
	abstract = {Graphviz is a heterogeneous collection of graph drawing tools containing batch layout programs (dot, neato, fdp, twopi); a platform for incremental layout (Dynagraph); customizable graph editors (dotty, Grappa); a server for including graphs in Web pages (WebDot); support for graphs as COM objects (Montage); utility programs useful in graph visualization; and libraries for attributed graphs. The software is available under an Open Source license. The article[1] provides a detailed description of the package. The Graphviz software began with a precursor of dot in 1988, followed by neato in the early 90{\textquoteright}s. The features expanded greatly over the years, driven by user request. Graphviz became Open Source in 2000, and was recently distributed on about 500,000 CDROMs as an add-on package for the SUSE Linux release, and is redistributed by Debian, Mandrake, SourceForge, and soon OpenBSD. 2 Areas of Application Thanks to the variety of components available and its open, {\textquotedblleft}toolkit {\textquotedblright} design, Graphviz supports a wide variety of applications. The foremost application is probably presentation layouts, such as including graphs in papers. As stream processors, the Graphviz tools can be used as co-processes with interactive components to provide dynamic layouts for debuggers, process monitors, program analysis software, etc. Graphviz tools have been adopted as a visualization service by the W3C Resource Description Framework},
