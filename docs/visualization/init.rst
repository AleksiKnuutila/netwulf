Interactive Visualization
-------------------------

TODO
~~~~

I guess I would highlight how to use the visualization here:

- explain what the controls do with the network
- explain how to toggle/choose nodes (I find this confusing sometimes because you click on a node but the label is still there because you're still hovering
- explain the network format when json is used
- explain the network format when CSV is used
- basically a GUI explanation
